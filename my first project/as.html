Hazratha Amma Jan Saheba rendered great khidmath to Hazrat Syed Nayab-e-Rasool. Historically 
Sarkar Nayabe Rasool is referred to as Hazrat Haji Syed Khwaja Rahmatullah (RA) Nayabe Rasool and 
is counted among the Hussaini Sadaat's (Descendants of the great Hazrat Syedna Imam Hussain Razi 
Allahu Ta'ala Anhu). His father Hazrat Khwaja-E-Alam Nakshband Alaihirrahmah had migrated to 
India from Tauran (northen parts of Afghanistan and present day Uzbekistan etc.). Khwaja 
Rahmatullah's father upon his arrival from Tauran, stayed for a brief while with the Asif Jah (Awwal) 
and thereafter was appointed as the Qateeb at the Jamia Masjid at Belgaum (Karnataka). Hazrat Khwaja 
Alam married in Belgaum which was also the birth place of Khwaja Rahmatullah. His (Khwaja 
Rahmatullah's) date of expiry has been given as 26 Rabbi Ul Awwal 1195 Hijri which translates to 1781 
AD in Georgian Calender. His age has been given as 90 Hijri years and thus his year of birth can be 
counted back to 1105 Hijri (1694 AD). Khwaja Rahmatullah took permission from his father and went 
to stay with his maternal aunt at Kurnool where he recieved his formal education and also took 
employment in the royal stable. Meanwhile he also visited Bijapur and took Baith from Hazrat Alvi 
Buroom (RA.). Later he performed Hajj (1151 Hijri/1737 AD) and also took Baith from Hazrat Ashraf 
Makki (RA) under the Nakshbandi tradition in Makkah Muazzamah from where he proceeded to 
Madina Shareef. After returning from Hajj Khwaja Rahmatullah stayed for a brief while at Kurnool and 
later went to Nandyal where he got married. From Nandyal Khwaja Rahmatullah came to Udgir Hill 
Fort and in 1748 AD bought some land and settled in Ana Samandar (Anuma Samudram) which later 
came to be known as Rahmatabad Shareef (named after Khwaja Rahmatullah himself). Hazrat Syeda 
Habeebunnisa (RA) was the second wife of Khwaja Rahmatullah and is popularly known as Ammajan 
by Hindus and Muslims alike. She was the daughter of the Nawab of Kurnool. In 1748 AD Khwaja 
Rahmatullah constructed a make shift mosque in Rahmatabad and named it Madina Masjid. Many 
people came forward to convert it into a permament structure but Khwaja Rahmatullah refused any help 
and later in 1762 AD he single handedly converted the makeshift structure into a grand one. There is an 
inscription on the forehead of the mosque which reads "This Stone Has Been Brought From Madina 
Munawwarah" but it is not certain whether Khwaja Rahmatullah had brought the stone himself or had 
got it through
someone else. Khwaja Rahmatullah did not had any children through his second wife. His second wife 
Hazrat syeda Habeebunnisa had constructed a grand dome atop the mazar of Khwaja Rahmatullah 
after his expiry. She herself was laid to rest next to the Mazar of Khwaja Rahmatullah inside the same 
dome after her expiry. According to the book 'Bahr-E-Rahmat' at the age of 90, Khwaja Rahmatullah 
fell seriously ill and expired on Friday 26 Rabbi Ul Awwal 1195 Hijri (22nd March 1781 AD) after 
Maghrib at Udgir. At the time of performong Ghusl his heart was still in a state of Zikr which was 
witnessed by everyone present there. His body was then brought to Rahmatabad and was laid to rest in 
the courtyard of the mosque that he had built. Today, a grand dome adorns the Mazar-E-Aqdas of 
Hazrat Khwaja Rahmatullah Nayabe Rasool and Ammajan and is frequented by thousands of pilgrims 
irrespective of caste, creed, religion and status.<br>
