This famous temple is in Jonnawada village at a distance of 13 kms from Nellore town in Andhra Pradesh. This temple was built in 1150 by Manumasiddhi on the northern bank of the Penna river. The temple tower has many tiers with various statues of gods and goddesses painted in various colors. There are five golden kalasams on the top of the tower. The Penna river is seen on the left side of Kamakshi’s temple. As soon as one enters the temple one can see a spacious yard with a Kalyana Mandapa where the ceremonial wedding of the Gods are performed. On the right side of this mandapam is seen a Dwajasthamba with a platform called Bali Peetham. After that one can see one big Nandi statue along with a smaller one. After that one enters a hall called Artha mandapa with many pillars decked with many sculptures depicting the legend of the temple. After crossing the Artha Mandapa one can see the shrine of Lakshmi Ganapati. In the inner sanctum Lord Mallikarjuna is seen. Beside that shrine Goddess Kamakshi is seen in standing posture with a goad (ankusha) and a noose (pasha) in the upper pair of hands and showing Abhaya and Varada Mudras with her lower pair of hands. The idol is tiny but is richly decorated with golden ornaments and jewels. Beside the shrine Sri Adi Sankaracarya is seen. He Installed Sri Chakra Yantra and made Her appear in benign form. In earlier times people used to offer animals as sacrificial offerings to Her. Outside the inner sanctum one can see the idols of Ganapati, Subrahmanaya with Valli and Devasena, Durga, ,Tarakeshwara, Annapoorneshwari, Surya, Lord Vishnu and Kala Bhairava. Beside the shrine of Durga Nava Grahas are seen on an elevated platform.<br>
<h2> HISTORY</h2>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
According to the legend in Skanda Purana, Sage Kasyapa searched for a holy place to conduct yagna. He came here and performed yagna with three sacrificial kundas. Lord Mallikarjuna emergred from the sacrficial kundam in effulgent form. Godess Kamakshi (a combined manifestation of Kali and Matangi) also came there and graced the place beside the Lord. The idol of Kamakshi was found by the fishermen in Penna River at Penuballi Village. Later King Manumasiddhi built a temple and installed the idols in the temple. The place where the yagna was performed was called “Rajathagiri” or “Yagnavatika” in earlier times. Later it came to be called as “Jonnawada”. In past times people used to sacrifice animals before the idol. Sri Sankaracharya installed a Srichakra Yantra and with his penance pacified the Goddess to appear in benign form.<br>

Lord Indra worshipped Godess Kamakshi here and got back his lost kingdom of heaven. Aswadhhama worshipped the Goddess and bathed in Penna River to get rid of his skin disease. The river near the temple is called Kasyapa Theertha and whoever bathes here will be relieved of his sins and troubles. Devotees believe that sleeping in this temple premises will bestow good fortune and progeny. People also believe that by taking Prasad called Kodi Mudda (a dish prepared with rice and green gram) during Brahmostavam will bless them with prosperity and good progeny. Many poojas and ceremonies take place in this temple. Navavarana Pooja (from 9.00 a.m. to 10.30 a.m), Sahasranamarchana (7.00 a.m. to 9.00 a.m. and 10.30 to 12.30 p.m.) and Kalyanosthavam (10.30 to 12.00 noon) are some of the special poojas. Performing Sahasrarchana Pooja to Lord Shiva gives merit equal to that of the merit acquired from reading four Vedas.<br></p>
