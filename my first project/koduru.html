The Koduru Beach is located at a distance of 20 km from the Nellore which was highly reputed in the 
late 13th century. The beach is situated on the sea shores of Bay of Bengal and it contributes some 
share of Coromandel Coast of India. Nellore is considered as a significant city since the great Indian 
poet Tikkana Somayaji who translated the epic Mahabharata into Telugu was born here. Government 
of Andhra
Pradesh has renamed Nellore in 2008 as Potti Sriramulu Nellore. This beach is a famous picnic spot of 
Nellore.<p>
