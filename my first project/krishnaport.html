<p>Nellore: The Central government has addressed a long standing demand of Krishnapatnam Port by 
designating the Port in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh as an authorised Immigration check post for 
entry into/exit from India with valid travel documents for all classes of passengers. Krishnapatnam 
Port, popularly known as KPCL is a privately built and owned all weather, deep water port on the east 
coast of India, located about 190 km north of the Chennai Port and 18 km east of Nellore city.<br>
The port is owned and operated by the Krishnapatnam Port Company Limited (KPCL), an offspring of 
Hyderabad-based CVR Group. The port is being built in three phases.
Post the completion of the first phase in a record time of 18 months, Krishnapatnam Port was 
dedicated to the nation on July 17, 2008. The Port has numerous strengths like area, location, weather 
and the promoters are confident that it is soon poised to become one of the biggest ports in the world. 
With the advent of Immigration check post, the port can convert vessels from foreign to coastal run 
and vice versa. The vessel crew can also sign in and sign off at KP port now, unlike in the past.</p>
