<p>According to the rock inscriptions, this temple was built by the Pallava king Narsimha Varma in 
the ninth century. It is believed that the sage Kashyapa established the temple on the bank of Pinakini 
(popularly known as Penna river
Legend goes that the sage Kasyapa established the temple on the bank of Pinakini. And the vedic 
scripture ‗Brahmapurana‘ reveals that the seven sages (Saptarishis) performed
‗yagnam‘ (Sacrifice) on the top of Narasimhakonda.
Narasimhakonda temple was constructed with the patronage of Pallava King Narasimha Varma in the 
9th century, according to the inscriptions. Scriptures say that the temple in Vedagiri was where Lord 
Narasimha appeared following a yagam done by Kashyapa Muni. The yagam involved rituals held at 
three important places – Vedagiri (Narasimhakonda), Ratnagiri / Jonnawada) and Talpagiri 
(Ranganayakulapeta, Nellore).<br>
As per history it is said that there are 7 devotional gundam(ponds)there and this place is very powerful 
and there will be a mark made by lord on hill which is clearly visible.
Unique Sight:
A visit to the abode of Lord Narasimha is memorable with the ‗gali gopuram‘ visible to visitors as one 
enters the verdant forests of Vedagiri. The rush of pilgrims has increased substantially after having 
provided additional facilities there.</p>
