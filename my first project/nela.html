Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary is a bird sanctuary in Tirupati district, Andhra Pradesh, India, 
near the village of Nelapattu. It has an area of 458.92 hectares. It is an important breeding site for 
spot-billed pelicans (Pelecanus philippensis).
Nelapattu has two major plant communities, Barringtonia swamp forests and southern dry evergreen 
scrub.
Southern dry evergreen scrub covers most of the sanctuary, including the 288 hectares of Kalluru 
Reserved Forest and 88 hectares of unreserved forest. The dominant tree and shrub species are 
Manilkara hexandra, Maba buxifolia, Memecylon edule, Buchanania angustifolia, Zizyphus 
xylopyrus, and others.<br>
The Barringtonia swamp forests are found in the 83-ha Nelapattu tank. The predominant tree species is 
Barringtonia acutangula (Hijal).<br> This tree also grows in uplands, but the tree species found at 
Nelapattu can grow in flooded conditions lasting for 5 to 7 months. The saplings can survive total 
submersion during the long duration of flooding.<br>
About 189 bird species can be found at Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary, 50 of which are migratory. In 
addition to the spot-billed pelican, it is an important breeding site for black-headed ibis, Asian 
openbill, black-crowned night heron, and little cormorant. Other migratory water birds that visit the 
sanctuary include northern pintail, common teal, little grebe, northern shoveler, Eurasian coot, 
Indian spot-billed duck, grey heron, Oriental darter, black-winged stilt, garganey and gadwall.</P>

The Pulicat Lake is the second largest brackish water lake or lagoon in India. The lake has gained its

conservationists have found out that the most concentration of flamingos can be seen in the periphery 
of the lake where the water level is below 40 cm. The Pulicat Lake has diverse kinds of algae, fish and 
other kinds of bethnic diversities and that makes it the most preferred destination for the Greater

We visited Nellapattu bird sanctuary in the first week of February 2021. This was in fact the first 
post COVID fullday outing we had done and it was worth it. There were plenty of migratory birds 
despite being close to the end of winter. We got to see pelicans, open billed storks, white ibis & 
cormorants. <br>The birds can be viewed
from a walk path built around a large water tank / natural reservoir. The walk path has view points and 
a couple of watch towers. What was lacking though is a guide to guide the visitors. There were only 2 
administrative staff- one at the ticket counter near the road & another near the administrative center. 
This could have been due to the COVID situation though. It would really help if the contact 
information for the sanctuary. Also the sanctuary is a bit away from the highway and the nearest place 
with a good restaurant is Sullurpet about 30km / 30 min. away.<br>
But the variety and number of birds does make up for the lack of facilities & all in all it was a trip 
worth the while.
