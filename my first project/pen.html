<p style="font-size:15px;"><font color="black">
The Penusila Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple is situated at the foot of a hill in the Penchalakona 
Valley. There is an image of the Lord, represented as a self-manifested one (Swayambhu). Two 
stones are entwined to form a lion‘s head upon a man's body.[1] The "Sthalapurana", or ancient story, 
of the temple indicates that it was a famed for the swami ―Thapovan of Kanvamaharshi‖ who 
performed penance there.[1]<br>
There is an annual festival[2] at the temple, which is a major event in Penchalakona, celebrated during 
Vaisakha, the period of time in the Hindu solar calendar that begins in mid-April in Bengal, Nepal, 
and Punjab. It starts on the day of Suddha Dwadasi and lasts until Bahula Padyami, a total of five 
days. Devotees congregate for Narasimhaswamy Jayanthi to celebrate the occasion.[3]</p>

Lord Maha Vishnu took the form of Narasimha Swamy (Body is of Human and Head is of Lion) 
to kill the demon Hiranyakasyapa. Even after killing the demon, the anger was not controlled and he 
started roaming the forests. To control his anger, Goddess Lakshmi took the form of tribal lady 
‗Chenchu Lakshmi‘ to please Narasimha Swamy. Chenchu Lakshmi hugged Narasimha Swamy at 
this place to control the anger. Hug in Telugu called as Penu Vesukonuta. Thus the place got the name 
‗Penusila‘, as time passes by the name changed to Penchalakona.
Another version of Penchalakona, Lord after killing demon Hiranya Kasyapa took the bath in 
Penchalakona to withdraw Narasimha Avatar and shed the anger and fierceness. Lord Narasimha 
Swamy manifested here in Yoga Mudra. ‗Penusila Kona‘ which means means ‗Huge Rock Corner‘.
Somasila Narasimha Swamy is another name to the Lord here in this temple. This temple is one 
of the Nine manifestations of Narasimha Swamy.
It is believed that Sage Kanva did penance here.
