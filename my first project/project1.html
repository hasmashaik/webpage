<h1><font color="red" size="15" face="Bold Italic">NELLORE</font></h1>
<p>Nellore was ruled by Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty in the 3rd century BCE. Nellore was 
conquered by the rulers of the Pallava Dynasty and it was under their rule till the 6th century CE, 
subsequently the Chola rulers ruled Nellore for a long period of time. The Cholas met their decline in 
the 13th Century CE.</p>
The name of the district is derived from the name of the district headquarters, Nellore. The district's 
name was Vikrama Simhapuri until the 13th century, when it became known as Nellore.<br>
Historically the district was under the rule of mouryas, sathavahanas, pallavas, cholas, telugcholas, 
kakatias, pandyans etc. The great Telugu poet Tikkana Somayaji translated 15 parvas of Sanskrit
Mahabharata into Telugu in Nellore.<br>
The city derives its name from the Tamil, "nelli" which means rice, as paddy cultivation is the 
predominant occupation in this region. Nellore has a long history that streches back to the 6th century 
A.D. Once ruled by the Pallava and Chola dynastics, Golconda vassals, Nawabs of Arcot and the 
Vijayanagara kings, Nellore, which was in the erstwhile Madras State, became a part of Andhra 
Pradesh in 1956.<br>
It is supposed that Nellore was situated in Dandakaranya forests into which the Aryas first penetrated 
as adventurous sages with the rise of the Mouryan Empire Nellore also seems to have under its 
influence and was part of the Ashoka Empire in the 3rd century
B.C. It was next included in the Pallava Dominion between the fourth and sixth century A.D<br>

<h1><font color="blue" size="15" face="Bold Italic"> FORMATION OF 
NELLORE</font></h1>
</h2>Nellore district formed part of the composite Madras State till 1st October, 1953. On 1st 
November 1956 when the states were reorganized on a linguistic basis, this district came under the 
Andhra Pradesh State. The name of Nellore district has been changed as Sri Potti Sriramulu Nellore 
District on 4th June, 2008.</h2>

title="narasimha swami temple"  height="500px" width="500px><br>
<p>According to the rock inscriptions, this temple was built by the Pallava king Narsimha Varma in 
the ninth century. It is believed that the sage Kashyapa established the temple on the bank of Pinakini 
(popularly known as Penna river
Legend goes that the sage Kasyapa established the temple on the bank of Pinakini. And the vedic 
scripture ‗Brahmapurana‘ reveals that the seven sages (Saptarishis) performed
‗yagnam‘ (Sacrifice) on the top of Narasimhakonda.
Narasimhakonda temple was constructed with the patronage of Pallava King Narasimha Varma in the 
9th century, according to the inscriptions. Scriptures say that the temple in Vedagiri was where Lord 
Narasimha appeared following a yagam done by Kashyapa Muni. The yagam involved rituals held at 
three important places – Vedagiri (Narasimhakonda), Ratnagiri / Jonnawada) and Talpagiri 
(Ranganayakulapeta, Nellore).<br>
As per history it is said that there are 7 devotional gundam(ponds)there and this place is very powerful 
and there will be a mark made by lord on hill which is clearly visible.
Unique Sight:
A visit to the abode of Lord Narasimha is memorable with the ‗gali gopuram‘ visible to visitors as one 
enters the verdant forests of Vedagiri. The rush of pilgrims has increased substantially after having 
provided additional facilities there.</p>

<p>The Sri Ranganthaswami Temple in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India is a Hindu temple dedicated to 
Lord Ranganatha a resting form of Lord Vishnu. This temple, also called Talpagiri Ranganathaswami 
temple or Ranganayakulu is one of the oldest temples in Nellore. It is located on the banks of the Penna 
River and is believed to have
been constructed in the 12th century. Just before the main entrance of the temple is a huge tower, 
called Gaaligopuram, which literally means "wind tower". This tower is approximately 70 feet 
high and has 10 feet of gold plated vessels on top of it, called kalashams. The gopuram was 
constructed by Yeragudipati Venkatachalam panthulu. Every year during the month of March–
April (which varies according to the Indian calendar) a grand festival is celebrated. These are 
called Brahmotsavam.</p>

<p>This temple is one of the ancient temples in Nellore built on the southern bank of the Penna river. 
This temple is located at a distance of 3.2 kms from Nellore. The area where this temple exists is 
called ―Ranganayakula Peta.‖According to local legend sage Kasyapa performed a yagna here on 
Ekadasi day and Lord Vishnu appeared before him and stayed there. Adi Sesha, the divine serpent 
came here in the form of a hill called
―Talpa Giri‘ as Adi sesha, the couch on which the Lord sleeps, exists here as a hill. In the ―Aranya 
Kanda‖ of the epic Ramayana it is mentioned that Lord Rama visited this temple during his period of
exile.</p>
<p>This temple was built by Pallava kings during seventh and eighth centuries. The present main shrine 
and extensions were built by Chola kings in between 1178 and 1216 as per the stone inscriptions found 
in the temple premises. The 70-foot tall main tower (Gaali Gopuram) was built in 1781. The seventiered tower looks beautiful with many sculptures of gods and goddesses erected on the tower at 
different levels. The seven golden kalasams on the top of the temple tower were erected in 1949. In the 
sanctum the 10-foot long idol of Ranganatha is seen in reclining position (Pallikonda Perumallu in 
Tamil) on the divine serpent Adisesha. Near His feet 26-inch long idols of Sri Devi and Bhu Devi are 
seen. The idol of Lord Brahma is seen seated on the lotus rising from Lord‘s navel. The idol is facing 
west towards the river Penna. The thousand holy names of the Lord are seen painted on the outer walls 
so that the devotee can recite them while going round the temple.</p>
<p>The ancient gopuram built on the west side is visible on the way to the river from the temple. The 
present tall tower is seen on the east side. The shrine of Rajya Lakshmi (Ranga Nayaki) is seen on the 
southern side of the main temple. The shrine of Andal or Goda devi is on the northern side of the main 
shrine. The Northern doorway called Vaikunta dwaram is seen just beside Goda Devi‘s shrine. On 
Vaikuinta Ekadashhi the Lord gives darshan to devotees from this side.<br>
The hall of mirrors called ―Addala Mandapam‖ built in 1929 is seen on the southern side of the main 
temple. In this hall temple rituals and ceremonies are performed. The hall is decked with many painted 
frescoes depicting the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu, the episode of Gajendra Moksham (Lord 
Vishnu saving the elephant from the clutches of the crocodile) and the pictures of Alwars done in 
Tanjavur style. The colorful fresco of Lord Krishna sleeping on a floating leaf called ―Vatapatrasayi‖ is
seen on the ceiling. The other sub-temples are the shrines of Alwaar Sannidhi, Lord Narasimha and 
Lord Venkateshwara. In the temple premises there is a tree called
―Santana Vriksha‘. Devotees tie a piece of cloth with offerings as swings to the branches of this tree 
as they believe that they will be blessed with progeny by doing so. Near this tree there is a tunnel 
once used by sages to reach this temple.<br>
In this temple poojas and other rituals are done as per Paancharatra Agama. Special poojas are done 
during Brahmostava (between March and April) and on Vaikunta Ekadashi. Every day Tirumanjanam, 
Sahasra Namarchana (worshipping the Lord with one thousand names), Asthottaranamarachana( 
worshipping the Lord with one hundred and eight names, Nitya Kalyanam are done. The temple timings 
are from 6.00 a.m. to
12.00 noon and from 2.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. As this temple is located in the north side of Sri Rangam,
this holy temple is regarded as the ―Sri Rangam of the North‖. Just on the way to river side there is a 
shrine for the great poet sitting Tikkana who was said to have translated the fifteen cantos of the epic 
Mahabharata in this temple. The view of the Penna River from the temple gives a panoramic view of 
the city. But the waters of the river are not so fresh and clean. The river near the temple should be 
maintained pure and clean. Many devotees are seen lighting oil lamps near the entrance. This practice 
should be stopped as it causes inconvenience to visitors entering the temple.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;"><font color="black">
This famous temple is in Jonnawada village at a distance of 13 kms from Nellore town in Andhra Pradesh. This temple was built in 1150 by Manumasiddhi on the northern bank of the Penna river. The temple tower has many tiers with various statues of gods and goddesses painted in various colors. There are five golden kalasams on the top of the tower. The Penna river is seen on the left side of Kamakshi’s temple. As soon as one enters the temple one can see a spacious yard with a Kalyana Mandapa where the ceremonial wedding of the Gods are performed. On the right side of this mandapam is seen a Dwajasthamba with a platform called Bali Peetham. After that one can see one big Nandi statue along with a smaller one. After that one enters a hall called Artha mandapa with many pillars decked with many sculptures depicting the legend of the temple. After crossing the Artha Mandapa one can see the shrine of Lakshmi Ganapati. In the inner sanctum Lord Mallikarjuna is seen. Beside that shrine Goddess Kamakshi is seen in standing posture with a goad (ankusha) and a noose (pasha) in the upper pair of hands and showing Abhaya and Varada Mudras with her lower pair of hands. The idol is tiny but is richly decorated with golden ornaments and jewels. Beside the shrine Sri Adi Sankaracarya is seen. He Installed Sri Chakra Yantra and made Her appear in benign form. In earlier times people used to offer animals as sacrificial offerings to Her. Outside the inner sanctum one can see the idols of Ganapati, Subrahmanaya with Valli and Devasena, Durga, ,Tarakeshwara, Annapoorneshwari, Surya, Lord Vishnu and Kala Bhairava. Beside the shrine of Durga Nava Grahas are seen on an elevated platform.<br>
<h2> HISTORY</h2>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
According to the legend in Skanda Purana, Sage Kasyapa searched for a holy place to conduct yagna. He came here and performed yagna with three sacrificial kundas. Lord Mallikarjuna emergred from the sacrficial kundam in effulgent form. Godess Kamakshi (a combined manifestation of Kali and Matangi) also came there and graced the place beside the Lord. The idol of Kamakshi was found by the fishermen in Penna River at Penuballi Village. Later King Manumasiddhi built a temple and installed the idols in the temple. The place where the yagna was performed was called “Rajathagiri” or “Yagnavatika” in earlier times. Later it came to be called as “Jonnawada”. In past times people used to sacrifice animals before the idol. Sri Sankaracharya installed a Srichakra Yantra and with his penance pacified the Goddess to appear in benign form.<br>

Lord Indra worshipped Godess Kamakshi here and got back his lost kingdom of heaven. Aswadhhama worshipped the Goddess and bathed in Penna River to get rid of his skin disease. The river near the temple is called Kasyapa Theertha and whoever bathes here will be relieved of his sins and troubles. Devotees believe that sleeping in this temple premises will bestow good fortune and progeny. People also believe that by taking Prasad called Kodi Mudda (a dish prepared with rice and green gram) during Brahmostavam will bless them with prosperity and good progeny. Many poojas and ceremonies take place in this temple. Navavarana Pooja (from 9.00 a.m. to 10.30 a.m), Sahasranamarchana (7.00 a.m. to 9.00 a.m. and 10.30 to 12.30 p.m.) and Kalyanosthavam (10.30 to 12.00 noon) are some of the special poojas. Performing Sahasrarchana Pooja to Lord Shiva gives merit equal to that of the merit acquired from reading four Vedas.<br></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;"><font color="black">
The Penusila Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple is situated at the foot of a hill in the Penchalakona 
Valley. There is an image of the Lord, represented as a self-manifested one (Swayambhu). Two 
stones are entwined to form a lion‘s head upon a man's body.[1] The "Sthalapurana", or ancient story, 
of the temple indicates that it was a famed for the swami ―Thapovan of Kanvamaharshi‖ who 
performed penance there.[1]<br>
There is an annual festival[2] at the temple, which is a major event in Penchalakona, celebrated during 
Vaisakha, the period of time in the Hindu solar calendar that begins in mid-April in Bengal, Nepal, 
and Punjab. It starts on the day of Suddha Dwadasi and lasts until Bahula Padyami, a total of five 
days. Devotees congregate for Narasimhaswamy Jayanthi to celebrate the occasion.[3]</p>

Lord Maha Vishnu took the form of Narasimha Swamy (Body is of Human and Head is of Lion) 
to kill the demon Hiranyakasyapa. Even after killing the demon, the anger was not controlled and he 
started roaming the forests. To control his anger, Goddess Lakshmi took the form of tribal lady 
‗Chenchu Lakshmi‘ to please Narasimha Swamy. Chenchu Lakshmi hugged Narasimha Swamy at 
this place to control the anger. Hug in Telugu called as Penu Vesukonuta. Thus the place got the name 
‗Penusila‘, as time passes by the name changed to Penchalakona.
Another version of Penchalakona, Lord after killing demon Hiranya Kasyapa took the bath in 
Penchalakona to withdraw Narasimha Avatar and shed the anger and fierceness. Lord Narasimha 
Swamy manifested here in Yoga Mudra. ‗Penusila Kona‘ which means means ‗Huge Rock Corner‘.
Somasila Narasimha Swamy is another name to the Lord here in this temple. This temple is one 
of the Nine manifestations of Narasimha Swamy.
It is believed that Sage Kanva did penance here.

Sri Arul Jyothi Nagaraja Murthy Peetadhipathi of Sri Raja Rajeswari Peetam in Arcot district of
Tamil Nadu was traveling to Vijayawada in 1965. He became tired and took a rest at Durgamitta.
While taking rest he felt the presence of Goddess Rajarajeswari Devi in the land opposite to him and
asked the local peoples to construct a temple on the same land.
Mr.Ratnaswamy Mudaliar took permission from the then Collector and constructs the temple in the
same year. In 1985 the Endowment department has taken over control.<br></p>

blessings to devotees with the other in ‗abhaya mudra‘ (no fear). Sweet Juice of Sugarcane

<h3>BARA SHAHID DARGA</h3>
<center><img src="https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3kk54/article29402969.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/13VJPG4-PANDUGA" title="barashahid dargah" border="3" width="600" 
height="600"></center>
<p style="font-size:15px;"><font color="black">
The Bara Shahid dargah located on the bank of a lake in Nellore town, Nellore district of Andhra 
Pradesh springs into prominence every year when the day after Muharram festival a popular festival 
called ‗Rottela Panduga‘ is held. <br>
Several folklore stories are in vogue regarding the origin of Bara Shaheed dargah. According to one 
version, 12 Islamic preachers from Turkey came to India and went around doing Tablighi 
(proselytizing or conveying of Islam). When they reached a place called Gandhavaram, the locals 
opposed the preaching of Islam. A battle ensued and the locals killed the 12 Tablighi. The present 
dargah is the place where they were killed.
Another version of the origin of Bara Shahid Dargah is that it is built in the memory of 12 Muslim 
Nawabs from Karnataka who gave their lives who laid down their lives for the sake of peace, 
communal harmony and goodwill. It is believed that they lost their lives in a war some 1200 years 
ago and their chopped heads fell at a place at Nellore (the present location of the dargah).<br></p>

<p style="font-size:15px;">
According to another version, the Nawab of Arcot had summoned a regiment from Turkey to fight 
against the British in the year 1751, a year which marked the siege of Arcot during a series of Carnatic 
wars. Twelve soldiers in the regiment were highly religious and performed Namaz five times a day and 
observed all the rules of their faith. Though the regiment won, the 12 warriors were beheaded by the 
rival forces in the battle at a place called Gandavaram, 15 km from Nellore. The headless bodies were 
brought back on the horses they were riding to the present Dargah area in Nellore and the place became 
popular as Bara Shaheed Dargah because they were laid to rest at the place and a Dargah was built 
thereafter.
Thus, the shrine of the 12 martyrs is named ‗Bara Shaheed Dargah‘. ‗Bara‘ means twelve and 
‗Shaheed‘ means martyrs, according to the tale. Word spread about the power of the warriors to 
grant the desires of the devout after the wife of then Arcot Nawab was cured of a serious illness 
when she offered prayers at the tombs of the 12 warriors.<br>
<h1><font size="6" color="red" face="impact">ROTI FESTIVAL OR ‗ROTTELA PANDUGA‘:
</font></h1>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
As a token of reverence, the queen, along with the Nawab, distributed Rotis among the warriors and 
later to the locals and devotees throng the Dargah on the 12th day of the Muharram month. Offering 
rotis during the Muharram month has become a tradition since then.<br>
Based on the desire of the devotees, the rotis are named Sowbhagya (good fortune) roti, Vidya 
(education) roti, Udyoga (employment) roti, Vivaha (marriage) roti, Santana (children) roti, Dhana 
(money) roti and even Visa roti. The roti vendors make a fast buck by catering to specific 
requirements. The exchange of Rotis takes place at the Nellore tank, also known as ‗Swarnala 
Cheruvu‘, located close to the dargah.

<br>
<h3><font color="blue" face="impact">SHIA ORIGINS OF THE BARA SHAHID DARGAH:</font></h3>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
The celebration of Roti festival the day after the Moharrum festival, the association of Arcot Nawabs 
with this shrine and the tradition of 12 martyrs of Shia Islam lend strength to the Shia origins of this 
shrine. The Arcot Nawabs belonged to three successive and different lineages: Zulfikar Khan and 
Daud Khan Panni, the original appointees of Aurangzeb, followed by the Nawayati Nawabs. In the 
1740s, the Wallajah line of Nawabs came into being. The early Nawabs were followers of Shia branch 
of Islam and the latter were followers of Sunni Islam.
<h3><font color="red" face="impact">The history of Muharram:</font></h3>
<p style="font-size:15px;">
The Battle of Karbala was fought on 10 October 680 A.C.E (10 Muharram in the year 61 AH of the 
Islamic calendar) between the army of the second Umayyad Caliph Yazid I and a small army led by 
Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, at Karbala in modern-day Iraq.
<h3>
The humiliation of Imam Hussain and others after the Battle of Karbala:</h3>
<center><img src="https://images.news18.com/telugu/uploads/2019/08/index-5.jpg?im=Resize,width=509,aspect=fit,type=normal" title="barashahid dargah" border="3"></center>

<p style="font-size:15px;">
According to Shia chronicles of the battle of Karbala, Hussain fell on the ground face- down and an 
attacker named Sinan ibn Anas stabbed and then decapitated him. Seventy or seventy-two people died 
on Husayn‘s side,of whom about twenty were descendants of Abu Talib, the father of Ali. This 

included two of Husayn‘s sons, six of his paternal brothers. Following the battle, Husayn‘s clothes 
were stripped, and his sword, shoes and baggage were taken. The bodies of Husayn‘s companions 
were decapitated. The members of the Banu Asad tribe, from the nearby village of Ghadiriya, buried 
the headless bodies of Husayn‘s companions.<br>
The members of the family of Imam Husain were taken as prisoners of war, put in chains and were 
forced to match bared-footed to Kufa, and from Kufa to Damascus. It is said that several of the younger 
children on this journey died on the route through the harsh conditions of travel and ill treatment of the 
family who were paraded in several towns along the route. They were often humiliated and assaulted by 
bystanders. Yazid had ordered for the city to be decorated and jubilant crowds had gathered to celebrate 
the capture of the prisoners. The heads of Imam Hussain and his companions were put up for public 
display in Damascus and subjected to further humiliation. The family of Imam Hussain were paraded in 
the market of Damascus. Some historians note that bystanders attacked them with rubbish stones and 
even hot water was thrown at the family. It is one of the most tragic chapters of Islamic history. It was 
never expected or even thought that such a harsh treatment would be meted out to the beloved grandson 
of Prophet Muhammad (SAW).<br>
A memorial to the 12 martyrs of Shia Islam was constructed at the Emeveyye mosque in Damascus, 
Syria. Cloth bundles representing the heads of the martyrs are displayed inside the memorial. The 
beheading of the martyrs of Karbala and transportation of their severed heads to Damascus, Syria soon 
after the battle of Karbala in 680 A.C.E. is converted into folklore surrounding the Bara Shahid 
Dargah, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh and given a local colour. The story of the heads of martyrs falling at 
the present location can be compared with the incidents that happened after the battle at Karbala in 680 
A.C.E.<br>

Hazratha Amma Jan Saheba rendered great khidmath to Hazrat Syed Nayab-e-Rasool. Historically 
Sarkar Nayabe Rasool is referred to as Hazrat Haji Syed Khwaja Rahmatullah (RA) Nayabe Rasool and 
is counted among the Hussaini Sadaat's (Descendants of the great Hazrat Syedna Imam Hussain Razi 
Allahu Ta'ala Anhu). His father Hazrat Khwaja-E-Alam Nakshband Alaihirrahmah had migrated to 
India from Tauran (northen parts of Afghanistan and present day Uzbekistan etc.). Khwaja 
Rahmatullah's father upon his arrival from Tauran, stayed for a brief while with the Asif Jah (Awwal) 
and thereafter was appointed as the Qateeb at the Jamia Masjid at Belgaum (Karnataka). Hazrat Khwaja 
Alam married in Belgaum which was also the birth place of Khwaja Rahmatullah. His (Khwaja 
Rahmatullah's) date of expiry has been given as 26 Rabbi Ul Awwal 1195 Hijri which translates to 1781 
AD in Georgian Calender. His age has been given as 90 Hijri years and thus his year of birth can be 
counted back to 1105 Hijri (1694 AD). Khwaja Rahmatullah took permission from his father and went 
to stay with his maternal aunt at Kurnool where he recieved his formal education and also took 
employment in the royal stable. Meanwhile he also visited Bijapur and took Baith from Hazrat Alvi 
Buroom (RA.). Later he performed Hajj (1151 Hijri/1737 AD) and also took Baith from Hazrat Ashraf 
Makki (RA) under the Nakshbandi tradition in Makkah Muazzamah from where he proceeded to 
Madina Shareef. After returning from Hajj Khwaja Rahmatullah stayed for a brief while at Kurnool and 
later went to Nandyal where he got married. From Nandyal Khwaja Rahmatullah came to Udgir Hill 
Fort and in 1748 AD bought some land and settled in Ana Samandar (Anuma Samudram) which later 
came to be known as Rahmatabad Shareef (named after Khwaja Rahmatullah himself). Hazrat Syeda 
Habeebunnisa (RA) was the second wife of Khwaja Rahmatullah and is popularly known as Ammajan 
by Hindus and Muslims alike. She was the daughter of the Nawab of Kurnool. In 1748 AD Khwaja 
Rahmatullah constructed a make shift mosque in Rahmatabad and named it Madina Masjid. Many 
people came forward to convert it into a permament structure but Khwaja Rahmatullah refused any help 
and later in 1762 AD he single handedly converted the makeshift structure into a grand one. There is an 
inscription on the forehead of the mosque which reads "This Stone Has Been Brought From Madina 
Munawwarah" but it is not certain whether Khwaja Rahmatullah had brought the stone himself or had 
got it through
someone else. Khwaja Rahmatullah did not had any children through his second wife. His second wife 
Hazrat syeda Habeebunnisa had constructed a grand dome atop the mazar of Khwaja Rahmatullah 
after his expiry. She herself was laid to rest next to the Mazar of Khwaja Rahmatullah inside the same 
dome after her expiry. According to the book 'Bahr-E-Rahmat' at the age of 90, Khwaja Rahmatullah 
fell seriously ill and expired on Friday 26 Rabbi Ul Awwal 1195 Hijri (22nd March 1781 AD) after 
Maghrib at Udgir. At the time of performong Ghusl his heart was still in a state of Zikr which was 
witnessed by everyone present there. His body was then brought to Rahmatabad and was laid to rest in 
the courtyard of the mosque that he had built. Today, a grand dome adorns the Mazar-E-Aqdas of 
Hazrat Khwaja Rahmatullah Nayabe Rasool and Ammajan and is frequented by thousands of pilgrims 
irrespective of caste, creed, religion and status.<br>

The designs are new and the space looks completely different, but S2 is here to continue what 
Raghava Cine Complex has accomplished over the last 30 years – provide you with a wonderful 
movie going experience. The space will be re-launched with a completely new look on Wednesday, 
October 12th, 2011 by Dr. Vijay Mallya, Chairman UB Group and Megastar Padmabushan Dr. 
Chiranjeevi, in the honorable presence of a number of dignitaries.
<h1><font color="red" size="7">A Brief History of Raghava Cine 
Complex</font></h1>

<p style="font-size:15px;">
Raghava Cine Complex was launched on July 27, 1980 by the Chairman of McDowell & Co. Ltd. -
late Sri. Vittal Mallya in the presence of the legendary cine artiste, honourable Sri. N.T. Rama Rao, 
Revenue Minister - Sri. N. Janardhan Reddy, and Ex- Governor of Uttar Pradesh - Sri. B. Gopal 
Reddy.
Over the last three decades, Raghava Cine Complex has been a household name in Nellore, bringing 
you movies from big banners across the country with many of your favourites running well over 100 
days. These memories will always be cherished and would not have been possible without the late 
Magunta Subbarama Reddy, who was the visionary behind this legendary theatre, a man whose 
mission was to bring the best movies to the people of Nellore. Raghava Cine Complex was the first of 
its kind in Andhra Pradesh with three screens, completely air-conditioned designed to entertain movie 
lovers.

Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary is a bird sanctuary in Tirupati district, Andhra Pradesh, India, 
near the village of Nelapattu. It has an area of 458.92 hectares. It is an important breeding site for 
spot-billed pelicans (Pelecanus philippensis).
Nelapattu has two major plant communities, Barringtonia swamp forests and southern dry evergreen 
scrub.
Southern dry evergreen scrub covers most of the sanctuary, including the 288 hectares of Kalluru 
Reserved Forest and 88 hectares of unreserved forest. The dominant tree and shrub species are 
Manilkara hexandra, Maba buxifolia, Memecylon edule, Buchanania angustifolia, Zizyphus 
xylopyrus, and others.<br>
The Barringtonia swamp forests are found in the 83-ha Nelapattu tank. The predominant tree species is 
Barringtonia acutangula (Hijal).<br> This tree also grows in uplands, but the tree species found at 
Nelapattu can grow in flooded conditions lasting for 5 to 7 months. The saplings can survive total 
submersion during the long duration of flooding.<br>
About 189 bird species can be found at Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary, 50 of which are migratory. In 
addition to the spot-billed pelican, it is an important breeding site for black-headed ibis, Asian 
openbill, black-crowned night heron, and little cormorant. Other migratory water birds that visit the 
sanctuary include northern pintail, common teal, little grebe, northern shoveler, Eurasian coot, 
Indian spot-billed duck, grey heron, Oriental darter, black-winged stilt, garganey and gadwall.</P>

The Pulicat Lake is the second largest brackish water lake or lagoon in India. The lake has gained its 
name from the Pulicat village, a small village situated at the southern parts of the lake. 
Dugarajupatnam and Sullurpeta are two important towns on the boundaries of the lagoon. Pulicat 
Lake Bird Sanctuary is a famous bird sanctuary in the area and the most important tourist destination 
in this part of Andhra Pradesh. This bird sanctuary encompasses more than 480 sq km area in 
total.<br>
The Pulicat Bird Sanctuary is a heaven for the bird lovers. Every year, more than15,000 Greater 
Flamingos migrate to the lake. Apart from flamingos, other different exotic species of birds like 
kingfishers, herons, painted storks, spoonbills and ducks can be seen in the bird sanctuary. The 
conservationists have found out that the most concentration of flamingos can be seen in the periphery 
of the lake where the water level is below 40 cm. The Pulicat Lake has diverse kinds of algae, fish and 
other kinds of bethnic diversities and that makes it the most preferred destination for the Greater 
Flamingos.<br>
The Andhra Pradesh side of the lake is considered as the best position to watch different species of 
birds. Apart from the Greater Flamingos, Spoon Billed Flamingos, different species of herons and 
egrets, Painted Stork, different types of ducks, around 20 species of shorebirds, terns, Asian Openbill 
Stork, Indian Cormorant, gulls, Lesser Whistling Teal, Black-headed Ibis, Little Cormorant, Little 
Grebe, Eurasian Spoonbill, Great Thick-knee Spotbill Duck, and Stone Curlew, Ruddy Shelduck, Barheaded Goose, Gadwall, Eurasian Wigeon, Gull-billed Tern are some of the important species of birds 
that can be seen in Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary. Birds of prey like White-bellied Sea Eagle, Osprey,

<h3><font size="30" color="darkred" face="impact">How to Reach Pulicat Bird

<p style="font-size:15px;">
We visited Nellapattu bird sanctuary in the first week of February 2021. This was in fact the first 
post COVID fullday outing we had done and it was worth it. There were plenty of migratory birds 
despite being close to the end of winter. We got to see pelicans, open billed storks, white ibis & 
cormorants. <br>The birds can be viewed
from a walk path built around a large water tank / natural reservoir. The walk path has view points and 
a couple of watch towers. What was lacking though is a guide to guide the visitors. There were only 2 
administrative staff- one at the ticket counter near the road & another near the administrative center. 
This could have been due to the COVID situation though. It would really help if the contact 
information for the sanctuary. Also the sanctuary is a bit away from the highway and the nearest place 
with a good restaurant is Sullurpet about 30km / 30 min. away.<br>
But the variety and number of birds does make up for the lack of facilities & all in all it was a trip 
worth the while.

tickets conveniently. In some of the water parks there is a flat rate for all the rides and in some, you 
have a fixed entry fee that covers certain rides; for the rest of the rides in the amusement park, you will 
be charged separately. Some of the water parks Nellore has allow you to reserve your tickets online 
which prove extremely comfortable because you can avoid the queues, which is usually longer on
weekends.
You need to carry the printout of your e-ticket and exchange it for a valid ticket.<br>

<p>Nellore: The Central government has addressed a long standing demand of Krishnapatnam Port by 
designating the Port in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh as an authorised Immigration check post for 
entry into/exit from India with valid travel documents for all classes of passengers. Krishnapatnam 
Port, popularly known as KPCL is a privately built and owned all weather, deep water port on the east 
coast of India, located about 190 km north of the Chennai Port and 18 km east of Nellore city.<br>
The port is owned and operated by the Krishnapatnam Port Company Limited (KPCL), an offspring of 
Hyderabad-based CVR Group. The port is being built in three phases.
Post the completion of the first phase in a record time of 18 months, Krishnapatnam Port was 
dedicated to the nation on July 17, 2008. The Port has numerous strengths like area, location, weather 
and the promoters are confident that it is soon poised to become one of the biggest ports in the world. 
With the advent of Immigration check post, the port can convert vessels from foreign to coastal run 
and vice versa. The vessel crew can also sign in and sign off at KP port now, unlike in the past.</p>

Satish Dhawan Space Centre - SDSC (formerly Sriharikota Range - SHAR)[1] is a rocket 
launch
centre (spaceport) operated by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is located in
Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. Sriharikota Range was renamed in 2002 after ISRO's former
chairman Satish Dhawan.

<h1><font color="red" size="6">History</font></h1>
Sriharikota island was chosen in 1969 for a satellite launching station. The centre became
operational in 1971 when an RH-125 sounding rocket was launched.[2] The first attempted 
launch
of an orbital satellite, Rohini 1A aboard a Satellite Launch Vehicle, took place on 10 August 1979,
but due to a failure in thrust vectoring of the rocket's second stage, the satellite's orbit decayed on 19
August 1979.[3] SHAR was named as 'Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR' (SDSC), on 5 September
2002, in memory of Satish Dhawan, former Chairman of the ISRO.
The SHAR facility now consists of two launch pads, with the second built in 2005. The second launch
pad was used for launches beginning in 2005 and is a universal launch pad, 
accommodating all of
the launch vehicles used by ISRO. The two launch pads will allow multiple launchesin a single year,
which was not possible earlier. India's lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 launched from the centre at 6:22
AM IST on 22 October 2008. India's first Mars orbiter Mangalyaan was launched from the centre on
5 November 2013, which was successfully placed into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.
Initially under Indian Human Spaceflight Programme existing launch facilities will be augmented to
meet the target of launching a crewed spacecraft called Gaganyaan.[4]
SDSC's current director is Arumugam Rajarajan.[5][6] He took over from S. Pandian in July 2019.

<h1><font color="blue" size="5">Facilities:</font></h1>
The SDSC has two operational orbital launch pads. SHAR is ISRO's satellite launching base 
andadditionally provides launch facilities for the full range of Rohini sounding rockets. The 
VehicleAssembly, Static Test and Evaluation Complex (VAST, previously STEX) and the Solid 
Propellant
Space Booster Plant (SPROB) are located at SHAR for casting and testing solid motors.
The site also has a Telemetry, Tracking, Range Instrumentation, & Control centre for Range Operation 
(RO),
Liquid Propellant Storage and Servicing Facilities (LSSF), the Management Service Group and
Sriharikota Common Facilities. The PSLV launch complex was commissioned in 1990.
It has a 3,450
tonne, 76.5 m high Mobile Service Tower (MST) which provides the SP-3 payload clean room.
<br>
The Solid Propellant Space Booster Plant (SPROB) processes large size propellant grains for the
satellite launch vehicles. The Vehicle Assembly & Launching Facility (VALF), Solid Motor
Preparation & Environmental Testing Facility (SMP&ETF) tests and qualifies different types of solid 
motor for launch vehicles. The control centre at SHAR houses computers and data processing,
closed circuit television, real-time tracking systems and meteorological observation equipment. It 
is
linked to eight radars located at Sriharikota and the five stations of ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking &
Command Network (ISTRAC).[citation needed]<br>
The propellant production plant produces composite solid propellant for rocket motors of ISRO using
ammonium perchlorate (oxidiser), fine aluminium powder (fuel) and hydroxyl terminated
polybutadiene (binder). The solid motors processed here include those for the first-stage booster
motor of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) — a five segmented motor of 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in)
diameter and 22 m (72 ft) length, weighing 160 tonnes (160 long tons; 180 short tons) with a thrust
level of 450 tonnes (440 long tons; 500 short tons).<br>
127
Rocket motors and their subsystems have to be rigorously tested and evaluated on ground 
before
they are declared flight worthy. The facilities at SDSC are used for testing solid rocket motors, both
at ambient conditions and simulated high altitude conditions. Besides these, there are facilities for
conducting vibration, shock, constant acceleration and thermal/humidity tests.<br>
SDSC has infrastructure for launching satellites into low Earth orbit, polar orbit and geostationary
transfer orbit. The launch complexes provide support for vehicle assembly, fueling, checkout and
launch operations. The Centre also has facilities for launching sounding rockets for atmospheric
studies. The mobile service tower, launch pad, preparation facilities for different launch stages &
spacecraft, storage, transfer and servicing facilities for liquid propellants, etc., are the principal 
parts
of the PSLV/GSLV launch complex.<br>
For supporting the GSLV Mark III, additional facilities were set up at SDSC. A new plant (SPP) 
is set
up to process heavier class boosters with 200 tonnes of Solid propellant. The static test complex is
being augmented for qualifying the S-200 booster. Other new facilities include a Solid Stage
Assembly Building, Satellite Preparation and Filling Facility and Hardware Storage buildings. 
The
existing liquid propellant and cryogenic propellant storage and filling systems, Propellant Servicing
Facilities will also be augmented. The range instrumentation system will be enhanced further.
[citation needed]<br>
SDSC also has a S band Doppler weather radar[13] that contributes to India 
Meteorological
128
Department radar network and serves as a stand-in for Doppler weather radar in 
Chennai.<br>
ISRO opened a viewing gallery at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in March 2019. The gallery faces
the two launchpads and can accommodate 5,000 people giving the general public the opportunity 
to witness rocket launches. The launch of PSLV-C45 on 1 April 2019 was the first launch that 
allowed spectators into the gallery.<br>
