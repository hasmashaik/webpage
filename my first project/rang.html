<p>The Sri Ranganthaswami Temple in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India is a Hindu temple dedicated to 
Lord Ranganatha a resting form of Lord Vishnu. This temple, also called Talpagiri Ranganathaswami 
temple or Ranganayakulu is one of the oldest temples in Nellore. It is located on the banks of the Penna 
River and is believed to have
been constructed in the 12th century. Just before the main entrance of the temple is a huge tower, 
called Gaaligopuram, which literally means "wind tower". This tower is approximately 70 feet 
high and has 10 feet of gold plated vessels on top of it, called kalashams. The gopuram was 
constructed by Yeragudipati Venkatachalam panthulu. Every year during the month of March–
April (which varies according to the Indian calendar) a grand festival is celebrated. These are 
called Brahmotsavam.</p>

<p>This temple is one of the ancient temples in Nellore built on the southern bank of the Penna river. 
This temple is located at a distance of 3.2 kms from Nellore. The area where this temple exists is 
called ―Ranganayakula Peta.‖According to local legend sage Kasyapa performed a yagna here on 
Ekadasi day and Lord Vishnu appeared before him and stayed there. Adi Sesha, the divine serpent 
came here in the form of a hill called
―Talpa Giri‘ as Adi sesha, the couch on which the Lord sleeps, exists here as a hill. In the ―Aranya 
Kanda‖ of the epic Ramayana it is mentioned that Lord Rama visited this temple during his period of
exile.</p>
<p>This temple was built by Pallava kings during seventh and eighth centuries. The present main shrine 
and extensions were built by Chola kings in between 1178 and 1216 as per the stone inscriptions found 
in the temple premises. The 70-foot tall main tower (Gaali Gopuram) was built in 1781. The seventiered tower looks beautiful with many sculptures of gods and goddesses erected on the tower at 
different levels. The seven golden kalasams on the top of the temple tower were erected in 1949. In the 
sanctum the 10-foot long idol of Ranganatha is seen in reclining position (Pallikonda Perumallu in 
Tamil) on the divine serpent Adisesha. Near His feet 26-inch long idols of Sri Devi and Bhu Devi are 
seen. The idol of Lord Brahma is seen seated on the lotus rising from Lord‘s navel. The idol is facing 
west towards the river Penna. The thousand holy names of the Lord are seen painted on the outer walls 
so that the devotee can recite them while going round the temple.</p>
<p>The ancient gopuram built on the west side is visible on the way to the river from the temple. The 
present tall tower is seen on the east side. The shrine of Rajya Lakshmi (Ranga Nayaki) is seen on the 
southern side of the main temple. The shrine of Andal or Goda devi is on the northern side of the main 
shrine. The Northern doorway called Vaikunta dwaram is seen just beside Goda Devi‘s shrine. On 
Vaikuinta Ekadashhi the Lord gives darshan to devotees from this side.<br>
The hall of mirrors called ―Addala Mandapam‖ built in 1929 is seen on the southern side of the main 
temple. In this hall temple rituals and ceremonies are performed. The hall is decked with many painted 
frescoes depicting the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu, the episode of Gajendra Moksham (Lord 
Vishnu saving the elephant from the clutches of the crocodile) and the pictures of Alwars done in 
Tanjavur style. The colorful fresco of Lord Krishna sleeping on a floating leaf called ―Vatapatrasayi‖ is
seen on the ceiling. The other sub-temples are the shrines of Alwaar Sannidhi, Lord Narasimha and 
Lord Venkateshwara. In the temple premises there is a tree called
―Santana Vriksha‘. Devotees tie a piece of cloth with offerings as swings to the branches of this tree 
as they believe that they will be blessed with progeny by doing so. Near this tree there is a tunnel 
once used by sages to reach this temple.<br>
In this temple poojas and other rituals are done as per Paancharatra Agama. Special poojas are done 
during Brahmostava (between March and April) and on Vaikunta Ekadashi. Every day Tirumanjanam, 
Sahasra Namarchana (worshipping the Lord with one thousand names), Asthottaranamarachana( 
worshipping the Lord with one hundred and eight names, Nitya Kalyanam are done. The temple timings 
are from 6.00 a.m. to
12.00 noon and from 2.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. As this temple is located in the north side of Sri Rangam,
this holy temple is regarded as the ―Sri Rangam of the North‖. Just on the way to river side there is a 
shrine for the great poet sitting Tikkana who was said to have translated the fifteen cantos of the epic 
Mahabharata in this temple. The view of the Penna River from the temple gives a panoramic view of 
the city. But the waters of the river are not so fresh and clean. The river near the temple should be 
maintained pure and clean. Many devotees are seen lighting oil lamps near the entrance. This practice 
should be stopped as it causes inconvenience to visitors entering the temple.</p>
