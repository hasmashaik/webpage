S2 will serve as the new symbol of contemporary style and design and carry forward the essence of 
some of the all-time greatest movies screened at this venue over the last three
decades. It will serve as the destination for an incredible yet affordable movie going experience, in a 
setting that is truly inspirational. The interiors are chic with the option of a ‗gold class‘ and all three 
screens are equipped with state- of-the-art technology to provide you with an experience like never 
before; an experience that cannot be matched.<br>
The designs are new and the space looks completely different, but S2 is here to continue what 
Raghava Cine Complex has accomplished over the last 30 years – provide you with a wonderful 
movie going experience. The space will be re-launched with a completely new look on Wednesday, 
October 12th, 2011 by Dr. Vijay Mallya, Chairman UB Group and Megastar Padmabushan Dr. 
Chiranjeevi, in the honorable presence of a number of dignitaries.
<h1><font color="red" size="7">A Brief History of Raghava Cine 
Complex</font></h1>

<p style="font-size:15px;">
Raghava Cine Complex was launched on July 27, 1980 by the Chairman of McDowell & Co. Ltd. -
late Sri. Vittal Mallya in the presence of the legendary cine artiste, honourable Sri. N.T. Rama Rao, 
Revenue Minister - Sri. N. Janardhan Reddy, and Ex- Governor of Uttar Pradesh - Sri. B. Gopal 
Reddy.
Over the last three decades, Raghava Cine Complex has been a household name in Nellore, bringing 
you movies from big banners across the country with many of your favourites running well over 100 
days. These memories will always be cherished and would not have been possible without the late 
Magunta Subbarama Reddy, who was the visionary behind this legendary theatre, a man whose 
mission was to bring the best movies to the people of Nellore. Raghava Cine Complex was the first of 
its kind in Andhra Pradesh with three screens, completely air-conditioned designed to entertain movie 
lovers.
