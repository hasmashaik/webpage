Satish Dhawan Space Centre - SDSC (formerly Sriharikota Range - SHAR)[1] is a rocket 
launch
centre (spaceport) operated by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is located in
Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. Sriharikota Range was renamed in 2002 after ISRO's former
chairman Satish Dhawan.

<h1><font color="red" size="6">History</font></h1>
Sriharikota island was chosen in 1969 for a satellite launching station. The centre became
operational in 1971 when an RH-125 sounding rocket was launched. The first attempted 
launch
of an orbital satellite, Rohini 1A aboard a Satellite Launch Vehicle, took place on 10 August 1979,
but due to a failure in thrust vectoring of the rocket's second stage, the satellite's orbit decayed on 19
August 1979. SHAR was named as 'Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR' (SDSC), on 5 September
2002, in memory of Satish Dhawan, former Chairman of the ISRO.<br>
The SHAR facility now consists of two launch pads, with the second built in 2005. The second launch
pad was used for launches beginning in 2005 and is a universal launch pad, 
accommodating all of
the launch vehicles used by ISRO. The two launch pads will allow multiple launchesin a single year,
which was not possible earlier. India's lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 launched from the centre at 6:22
AM IST on 22 October 2008. India's first Mars orbiter Mangalyaan was launched from the centre on
5 November 2013, which was successfully placed into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.
Initially under Indian Human Spaceflight Programme existing launch facilities will be augmented to
meet the target of launching a crewed spacecraft called Gaganyaan.
SDSC's current director is Arumugam Rajarajan. He took over from S. Pandian in July 2019.

<h1><font color="blue" size="5">Facilities:</font></h1>
The SDSC has two operational orbital launch pads. SHAR is ISRO's satellite launching base 
andadditionally provides launch facilities for the full range of Rohini sounding rockets. The 
VehicleAssembly, Static Test and Evaluation Complex (VAST, previously STEX) and the Solid 
Propellant
Space Booster Plant (SPROB) are located at SHAR for casting and testing solid motors.
The site also has a Telemetry, Tracking, Range Instrumentation, & Control centre for Range Operation 
(RO),
Liquid Propellant Storage and Servicing Facilities (LSSF), the Management Service Group and
Sriharikota Common Facilities. The PSLV launch complex was commissioned in 1990.
It has a 3,450
tonne, 76.5 m high Mobile Service Tower (MST) which provides the SP-3 payload clean room.
<br>
The Solid Propellant Space Booster Plant (SPROB) processes large size propellant grains for the
satellite launch vehicles. The Vehicle Assembly & Launching Facility (VALF), Solid Motor
Preparation & Environmental Testing Facility (SMP&ETF) tests and qualifies different types of solid 
motor for launch vehicles. The control centre at SHAR houses computers and data processing,
closed circuit television, real-time tracking systems and meteorological observation equipment. It 
is
linked to eight radars located at Sriharikota and the five stations of ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking &
Command Network (ISTRAC).[citation needed]<br>
The propellant production plant produces composite solid propellant for rocket motors of ISRO using
ammonium perchlorate (oxidiser), fine aluminium powder (fuel) and hydroxyl terminated
polybutadiene (binder). The solid motors processed here include those for the first-stage booster
motor of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) — a five segmented motor of 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in)
diameter and 22 m (72 ft) length, weighing 160 tonnes (160 long tons; 180 short tons) with a thrust
level of 450 tonnes (440 long tons; 500 short tons).<br>
Rocket motors and their subsystems have to be rigorously tested and evaluated on ground 
before
they are declared flight worthy. The facilities at SDSC are used for testing solid rocket motors, both
at ambient conditions and simulated high altitude conditions. Besides these, there are facilities for
conducting vibration, shock, constant acceleration and thermal/humidity tests.<br>
SDSC has infrastructure for launching satellites into low Earth orbit, polar orbit and geostationary
transfer orbit. The launch complexes provide support for vehicle assembly, fueling, checkout and
launch operations. The Centre also has facilities for launching sounding rockets for atmospheric
studies. The mobile service tower, launch pad, preparation facilities for different launch stages &
spacecraft, storage, transfer and servicing facilities for liquid propellants, etc., are the principal 
parts
of the PSLV/GSLV launch complex.<br>
For supporting the GSLV Mark III, additional facilities were set up at SDSC. A new plant (SPP) 
is set
up to process heavier class boosters with 200 tonnes of Solid propellant. The static test complex is
being augmented for qualifying the S-200 booster. Other new facilities include a Solid Stage
Assembly Building, Satellite Preparation and Filling Facility and Hardware Storage buildings. 
The
existing liquid propellant and cryogenic propellant storage and filling systems, Propellant Servicing
Facilities will also be augmented. The range instrumentation system will be enhanced further.
[citation needed]<br>
SDSC also has a S band Doppler weather radar[13] that contributes to India 
Meteorological
Department radar network and serves as a stand-in for Doppler weather radar in 
Chennai.<br>
ISRO opened a viewing gallery at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in March 2019. The gallery faces
the two launchpads and can accommodate 5,000 people giving the general public the opportunity 
to witness rocket launches. The launch of PSLV-C45 on 1 April 2019 was the first launch that 
allowed spectators into the gallery.<br>

<h2>
Sriharikota Island<br>
Sriharikota is partly located in Sullurpeta mandal and partly located in Tada mandal in Tirupathi
District in Andhra Pradesh and separates Pulicat Lake from the Bay of Bengal[2] The nearest town
and railway station is Sullurpeta which is 16 km west of Sriharikota and nearest city is Tirupati A 16
km elevated road connects Sriharikota to the mainland. It is about 70 km north of Chennai 
city. It
has elevation of 1 meter.</h2>

<h1><font color="blue" size="6">Climate</font></h1>
The climate of Sriharikota is tropical wet and dry (Aw; bordering on As) in the Köppen–
Geiger
climate classification system. Sriharikota has hot summers and mild winters. Summers can reach up
to 38 degrees Celsius, while winters can reach down to 20 degrees Celsius. Since Sriharikota 
is only
105 km north of Chennai, its climate is similar to that of Chennai.<br>
